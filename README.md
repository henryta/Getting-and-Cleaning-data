# Getting-and-Cleaning-data
This repository contains the R script, tidy data output file and Code Book produced as part of the Project assignment for the 
Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course in the Data Science Track. 

The script run_analysis.R processes the data gathered from experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age range of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing and Laying) while wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone. The embedded accelerometer and gyroscope captured the measurements for the subjects and the data obtained was partitioned into two data sets where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
